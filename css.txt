 p {
     color: blue;
     font-size : 20px;
     width: 200px;
 }

this syntaax means this will apply css formatting everywhere in the paragraph. it has property as color and value as below. This is how we 
declare.

Element,class & id selector :- 
p.big {
    font-size: 20px;
}


p {
     color: blue;
}
here p is element and it means each content inside <p>---</p> is written in blue color text

.blue{
    color: blue;
}

here blue is class character. It means whatever content inside <p class="blue">...</p>
<p>...</p> would've blue text and also <div class="blue"..</div> would've blue character

id= here we define the content with name, a pound sign at the begining, ex...
#name{
    color: blue;
}

<p>...</p>
<div id="name">...</div>

Combining selector :- 

combning a p element with some class selector ex,
p.big{
    font-szie: 2-x;
}
here p element will combine with class=big in <p></p>

<p class="big">...</p>
<div class="big">...</div>
so here <div> char will not be affected by the class=big in the text contents

Child selector = every p element which is direct link of it's article will be affected with the contents

article > p {
    color: blue;
}


<article>...
  <p>....</p>
</article>
This will be affected with the content

<p>....</p>
<article>...
   <div><p>...</p></div>
</article>
This will not be affected as it is not a direct child of article, rather a direct child for div tag


Descendant Selector :- Any article that is not a direct child of it's parent element

that is at any level of the element.

article p {
    color: blue;
}

Combining Selector
. Element with class selector (selector.class)
. Child (direct) selector (slector > selector)
. Descendant selector (selector slector)


Pseudo-Class Selector :- 
This is how you define this selector

selector:pseudo-class {
    ...
}

% osudo class selector we'll talk about
1. ::link
2. :visited
3. :hover
4. :active
5. :nth-child(...)
